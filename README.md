# Student Database Management System

The Student Database Management System is a comprehensive application designed for educational institutions, including schools and colleges, to automate the process of managing student records efficiently. This system simplifies the entry and retrieval of student information, offering features like file handling and data reloading for enhanced project functionality. This is the initial prototype of the project, with plans for future updates to further enrich its capabilities. Additionally, it includes 10 dummy student records for demonstration purposes.

## Features

- **Student Data Entry**: Easily input and manage student details, including names, IDs, courses, and more.
- **File Handling**: Store student records in files for data persistence and future reference.
- **Data Reloading**: Reopen and continue working with previously saved student data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A straightforward interface for hassle-free navigation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the application by running the standalone executable. For running the code, ensure you have GCC installed on your system.
   ```bash
   gcc main.c
   ./a (Windows users)
   ./a.out (Linux users)
   ```
3. Use the application to manage student records, add new data, and retrieve information.

## Usage

1. **Student Entry**: Add student details such as name, student ID, course, and any additional information as needed.
2. **Data Saving**: Save student records to a file for future access and data persistence.
3. **Data Loading**: Reload previously saved records for continued management.
4. **Data Retrieval**: Search for and retrieve specific student information using their student ID or other details.
